This is a project for a childrens theaterplay.
This is the first website that I published. I did the design (based on the design of the flyers of Maria Rigol). I composited the music of the play and I recorded the sound that you can hear on the website, I did and edited also the Drawings.
For this project I used, HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and I worked with some libraries.
