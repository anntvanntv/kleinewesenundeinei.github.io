This is a project for the childrenâ€™s theater play Kleine Wesen und ein Ei, created by theater educator Mar Taules to support inclusive education. 
This is the first website I published. I designed the site (based on Maria Rigol's flyer design). I composed the music for the play and recorded the audio featured on the website and I also created and edited the illustrations.
For this project, I used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and some libraries.
